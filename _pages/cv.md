Research Experience
======
* Exploring Innovative Approaches for a Lightweight Wheat Classification Model on Small-Scale Edge Devices <span style="float: right;">01/2025-present</span>
  * Improved the EfficientNetV2 architecture to enhance its suitability for wheat classification on small-scale edge devices, integrated modulation mechanism to improve network adaptability and classification performance 
  * Collected, cleaned, and organized the dataset, applied data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and cropping to enhance the model’s generalization ability and robustness 
  * Conducted multiple rounds of experiments to evaluate model performance using various metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, and AUC, optimized the model based on experimental results and documented the research process and findings in an academic paper

* A Deep Learning Approach for Rice Grain Detection <span style="float: right;">09/2024-12/2024</span> 
  * Attended the College Students’ Innovative Entrepreneurial Training Plan Program and conducted research on quality testing of rice grain, combined deep learning to test the quality of rice grains 
  * Collected and cleaned the dataset, eliminated noise, and applied data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and cropping to enhance data diversity and improve the model’s generalization ability
  * Modified the traditional ConvNext network to adapt to the rice grain detection task and used various evaluation metrics such as F1-score and AUC to comprehensively evaluate the model’s performance

* Identification and Optimization of Ecological Security Patterns Using a Bayesian Network Model: Based on Trade-offs in Ecosystem Services <span style="float: right;">07/2024-09/2024</span> 
  * Constructed a Bayesian network to probabilistically model the relationships between variables (e.g. rainfall, evapotranspiration, population density, etc.) and their states that affect ecosystem services 
  * Made sensitivity analysis of nodal factors using the constructed Bayesian network to identify the variables with the most significant impact on ecosystem service trade-offs, and further proposed the optimal subset of states for the key variables 
  * Leveraged Python to improve the efficiency of tedious calculations during experiments

> *"Ob nicht Natur zuletzt sich doch ergründe?"*

I am interested in Multi-modal Learning, especially the intersection of Vision and Language. 

Before infants acquire language, they begin perceiving the world through vision. Throughout life, nearly half of the human brain is directly or indirectly engaged in processing visual information, making vision a natural starting point for intelligence. Similarly, language is what sets humans apart from other species—it enables abstract thinking, communication, and cultural accumulation, all of which play an essential role in visual understanding as well. 

Based on these observations, I believe linguistic information can help computational models efficiently extract structured knowledge from the visual world. Thus, refining the interaction between vision and language to develop multimodal representations that better capture the full complexity of the visual world is one of the key directions to advancing model intelligence.
 

The CV part is ready, while the other sections are still under construction...

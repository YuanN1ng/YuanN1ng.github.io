> *"Ob nicht Natur zuletzt sich doch ergründe?"*  
> — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe


I am interested in Multimodal Learning, especially the intersection of Vision and Language.

Before infants acquire language, they begin perceiving the world through vision, making vision a natural starting point for intelligence. In turn, language—what sets humans apart from other species—enables abstract thinking that moves from phenomena toward underlying laws.

For models, however, raw visual information is weakly structured and overwhelmingly dense, making it too obscure to be observed as the initial substrate for building intelligence. By contrast, linguistic data accumulated over millennia can be seen as human-processed and compressed information, offering a friendlier starting point (as exemplified by LLMs). 

Based on these observations, I believe that, although their learning have different starting points, refining vision–language interaction plays a key role in improving models’ intelligence—just as it does in human intelligence. Therefore, my goal is to strengthen vision–language interaction, thereby enhancing models’ understanding.

> *"Ob nicht Natur zuletzt sich doch ergründe?"*

I am interested in Multimodal Learning, especially the intersection of Vision and Language.

Before infants acquire language, they begin perceiving the world through vision, making vision a natural starting point for intelligence. In turn, language—what sets humans apart from other species—enables abstract thinking that moves from phenomena toward underlying laws. However, since raw visual input is high-dimensional, continuous, and weakly structured, current models typically begin with language instead (e.g., LLMs).

Although humans and models start their journey from different points, I believe that vision–language interaction is key to improving model intelligence—just as it is for human intelligence. Therefore, my goal is to refine the interaction between these two modalities, thereby enhancing models’ understanding.

I am interested in Multimodal Learning, especially the intersection of Vision and Language.

Before children acquire language, they experience the world primarily through vision. Language then scaffolds abstraction, moving thought from raw percepts to underlying regularities. Human intelligence advances through the interaction between these two modalities. However, since visual input is high-dimensional and weakly structured, today’s systems—exemplified by LLMs—tend to adopt language rather than vision as their primary substrate of intelligence.

Humans and models may start from different points, I believe that vision–language interaction is crucial for advancing model intelligence—just as it is for human intelligence. Therefore, my goal is to design and refine this interaction to deepen models’ understanding.

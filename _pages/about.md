> *"Ob nicht Natur zuletzt sich doch ergründe?"*

I am interested in multimodal learning, especially the intersection of vision and language.

Before children acquire language, they experience the world primarily through vision. Language then scaffolds abstraction, moving thought from raw percepts to underlying regularities. Human intelligence advances through the interaction between vision and language.

Motivated by this, I believe that vision–language interaction is crucial for advancing models’ intelligence—just as it is for human intelligence. Therefore, my goal is to design and refine this interaction to strengthen cross-modal alignment, thereby improving models’ understanding.

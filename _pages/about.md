> *"Ob nicht Natur zuletzt sich doch ergründe?"*

I am interested in computer vision and the intersection of vision and language. 

Before infants acquire language, they begin perceiving the world through vision. Throughout life, nearly half of the human brain is directly or indirectly engaged in processing visual information, making vision a natural starting point for intelligence. Similarly, language is what sets humans apart from other species—it enables abstract thinking, communication, and cultural accumulation, all of which play an essential role in visual understanding as well. 

Therefore, linguistic information helps us efficiently extract structured knowledge from visual world. How can we further refine the interaction between vision and language, developing multimodal representations that better capture the full complexity of the visual world?
 

The CV part is ready, while the other sections are still under construction...

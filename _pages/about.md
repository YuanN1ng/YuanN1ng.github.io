> *“Ob nicht Natur zuletzt sich doch ergründe?”*  
> — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

I am interested in multimodal learning, especially the intersection of vision and language.

Before children acquire language, they experience the world primarily through vision; language then scaffolds abstraction, moving thought from raw percepts to underlying regularities. Human intelligence advances through the interaction between vision and language.

Motivated by this, I believe that vision–language interaction is crucial for advancing models’ intelligence—just as it is for human intelligence. My goal is to design and refine this interaction to strengthen cross-modal alignment and improve models’ understanding.

  <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</em> (Douglas Hofstadter, 1979) profoundly shaped my decision to pursue artificial intelligence.

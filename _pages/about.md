I am interested in the intersection of language and vision. What is the connection between them? Can we integrate them with other modalities to develop a vision foundation model that perceives, understands, and continually learns from reality, mainly through self-supervised learning, improving itself like a human child?

The CV part is ready, while the other sections are still under construction...
